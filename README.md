# Smart-Helmet-With-Multi-Features

## ABSTRACT

A smart helmet with multi-features is a type of protective headgear used by the rider which makes bike driving safer than before. The main purpose of this helmet
is to provide safety to the rider. The design and implementation of a smart helmet that integrates advanced features like alcohol detection, accident identification and location,
and panic emergency alert feature to improve the safety of motorcyclists. The helmet is equipped with a sensor module that detects the presence of the helmet on the rider's
head and wireless communication with a control module mounted on the motorcycle. The control module, which is connected to the ignition system of the motorcycle, is
designed to prevent the vehicle from starting if the helmet is not detected on the rider's head.

## METHODOLOGY
We are presenting an system consists of two modules, one in helmet is called helmet module and
other one in vehicle is called bike module the helmet is equipped with a sensor module that detects the
presence of the helmet on the rider's head and wirelessly communicates with a control module mounted on the
motorcycle The control module, which is connected to the ignition system of the motorcycle, is designed to
prevent the vehicle from starting if the helmet is not detected on the rider's head <br>
Proposed system of smart helmet with multi features has two functional modules, they are <br>
1 Helmet Module <br>
2 Bike Module <br><br>

## WORKING
The Smart Helmet with Multi
features works based on following cases to ensure the safety of the rider.<br>
Bike module can be following are: <br>

**If no helmet:**
Motorcyclists didn’t wear the helmet, then the ignition can’t be turn ON (Motor is off).
<br><br>
**If helmet weared:** 
Motorcyclist wearing the helmet, then the ignition can be turn ON (Motor is on).
<br><br>
**Accident detection:**
When happened accident to the motorcyclist, GPS and GSM will send’s the accident
alert send SMS with live location to the family and/or authorized number and due to accident ignition will
be off.
<br><br>
**Emergency SOS:**
when motorcyclist need help in emergency condition. Like medical emergency or any
problem by activating push button present in helmet module they can send the SMS to authorized numbers
with live location.<br><br>

## FUTURE SCOPE
-->Researching the possibility of integrating a solar panel into the helmet to extend the battery life and make
the system more environmentally friendly.
<br>
-->Implementing a more secure and reliable Wi
Fi communication protocol to ensure data privacy.
<br>
-->Designing a modular system that can be easily installed on different types of bikes and helmets, making it
more accessible to a wider range of riders.
<br>
-->The system could be optimized to reduce power consumption and extend the battery life. This could include
using low power components, optimizing the code, and implementing sleep modes when appropriate.
